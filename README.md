# Introduction

This is a work-in-progress repository where I plan to completely build a keyboard from scratch doing bare metal programming on an STM32L432 microcontroller.

# Dependencies
OpenOCD\
arm-none-eabi-gcc\

# TODO's
1. Learn what usb peripheral registers do.
2. Make small library abstracting away from working directly with USB registers.
3. Make library for USB enumeration and USB HID scancodes.
